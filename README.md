## Overview

The HoneyBee Blockchain Project is a Python-based implementation that integrates blockchain technology to track and reward honeybee farmers for their production. It ensures transparency and trust among stakeholders by using decentralized ledger technology. The project incentivizes farmers to participate in sustainable practices and rewards them with tokens backed by their honey production.

## Features

- **Enhanced Proof of Work**: Dynamically adjusts difficulty based on network hash rate.
- **Transaction Verification**: Ensures farmers have the required credentials to mint tokens.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Implements a Proof of Work consensus algorithm for block validation.
- **Smart Contracts**: Allows for more complex agreements and transactions between parties.
- **API and Interfaces**: Provides APIs for farmers to interact with the blockchain and manage tokens.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Utilizes IPFS for decentralized storage of transaction records.
- **Security Measures**: Implements encryption and secure communication channels.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increased transactions and participants without compromising performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/honeybee-blockchain.git
   cd honeybee-blockchain
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the blockchain server:

   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```

2. Access the API endpoints using your preferred HTTP client (e.g., Postman, curl).

## API Endpoints

- **GET /mine**: Mines a new block in the blockchain.
- **POST /transactions/new**: Creates a new transaction (minting tokens).
- **POST /farmers/register**: Registers a new farmer on the blockchain.
- **GET /farmers**: Retrieves the list of registered farmers.
- **GET /tokens/mint**: Mints new tokens based on honey production.
- **GET /tokens/balance/<farmer_id>**: Retrieves the token balance for a specific farmer.
